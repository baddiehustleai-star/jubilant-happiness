## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Developer

The repository is in a **starter template state**. To continue development:

1. **Set up Firebase:**

   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase init
   ```

2. **Add environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Fill in your API keys
   ```

3. **Start with authentication:**
   - Install: `npm install firebase react-router-dom`
   - Create: `src/config/firebase.js`
   - Build: Login/Signup pages

4. **Follow the phased roadmap above**

---

## ⚠️ Critical Gaps

1. **No actual product functionality** — The landing page looks nice but does nothing
2. **No user flows** — Can't upload photos, create listings, or cross-post
3. **No integrations** — Firebase, Stripe, OpenAI, remove.bg all missing
4. **No database** — No way to store or retrieve data
5. **Misleading README** — Describes features that don't exist yet

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Answer: No, this repo is NOT done.**

It's a well-structured starter template with:

- ✅ Excellent documentation
- ✅ Solid build/test infrastructure
- ✅ Beautiful UI foundation
- ❌ 0% of promised features implemented

**Estimated work remaining:** 12-16 weeks for a solo developer to reach MVP

**Next immediate step:** Decide whether to:

1. Continue building the full platform (major undertaking)
2. Update README to reflect actual state (starter template)
3. Archive the repo if scope has changed

## 📝 Notes

- All CI checks pass ✅
- Code quality is good
- Documentation is comprehensive
- The foundation is solid for building upon
- No technical debt or security issues detected
